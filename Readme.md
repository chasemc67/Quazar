## Display AR Controls Over Everything

Google Eddystone is a technology leveraging bluetooth and smartphones to launch web apps on your phone.

Quazar is a new spin on Eddystone, drawing AR controls over real world objects instead of prompting the user to open a web app.

Initiallty the AR controls will be triggered via QR codes, prompting the launching of pre-loaded code. 

In the future, a combination of device location and machine-learning will trigger code to be downloaded from the internet, displaying 
controls over objects in your physical space. More similar to the web app model of eddystone (dont need to download an app to use a vending machine).


Imagine: 
- looking at a bus stop, and seeing the live times. Interacting with a map of the route
- Looking at your light switch across the room, and being able to control it dim it.
- Getting a "view" over your view-less Amazon Echo (Echo Show is so 2017)
- Seeing volume and channel controls on any TV you look at (even the one in the doctors office)
